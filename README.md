# subleq

A OISC (one instruction set computer) emulator implementation, inspired by [Gary Explains @ YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRZDnetjGuo).

btw this implementation is wrong, i forgot that a byte can't be larger than a byte and ruby does not check that on its own lol. i only noticed this when rewriting it in rust
